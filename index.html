      <h1> Something something..I'm not busy" </h1>

      <p> Update on what I did today: -Installed Ruby on Rails - which includes headache of bitbucket and heroku..<br>
           also went with cloud9 cuz I can't workout
      how to do it in virtual machine(though I think I figured out what's wrong in it). </p>
    
    <h2> Brushing up with an old enemy..pointers </h2>
    <p> Day 2 - I'm doing some c++ examples and problem solving especially with pointers. I've forgotten how bothersome they are <br>
      I have to master it in the next few days so I'm prepared for CSE 100. Well <em>"master"</em> seems like a pretty loaded word to use<br>
      I take that back...I ain't mastering sh*t.</p>
    
    <h3> OMG this is hideous css styling, please forgive me! </h3>
    <p> Yeah I'm trying out and playing with ugly styles so I can get better at it...bare with me here </p>
    
    <h2> And more playing around.... </h2>

    <h2> Day 3 was just me dropping off people</h2>
    <p> Dropped off my roommates at the airport, some errands here and there(my gas money!)..I practiced html and css today by <br>
      cloning the google homepage(just the layout tho, no functionality yet)
  
  <br><br><br>
    <h2> Day 4 I did Ruby and cooked?</h2>
    <p> So I learned Ruby deployment today using c9's IDE, pushing changes to a git repository(in bitbucket sadly) and pushing it to
      heroku. Fun stuff you know..Also grades are up, I'm numb so idk.

    <h2> Day 6 </h2>
    <p> My head friggin hurts so I went back to doing pointers and why it's important in classes. I still don't get some of it but
      I'll be doing more for sure.....</p>

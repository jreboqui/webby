      <h1> Something something..I'm not busy" </h1>

      <p> Update on what I did today: -Installed Ruby on Rails - which includes headache of bitbucket and heroku..<br>
           also went with cloud9 cuz I can't workout
      how to do it in virtual machine(though I think I figured out what's wrong in it). </p>
    
    <h2> Brushing up with an old enemy..pointers </h2>
    <p> Day 2 - I'm doing some c++ examples and problem solving especially with pointers. I've forgotten how bothersome they are <br>
      I have to master it in the next few days so I'm prepared for CSE 100. Well <em>"master"</em> seems like a pretty loaded word to use<br>
      I take that back...I ain't mastering sh*t.</p>
